Analyzed data from two different sources to delve into standardized test scores. Provided summaries based on school, district, grade level. Also ranked the top and bottom 5 schools based on performance, and provided scores by school size, spending and type. Scores were pretty consistent across grade levels for each school, and Charter schools outperformed District schools.
